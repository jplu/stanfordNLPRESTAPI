    REST API over Stanford CoreNLP framework to get results in NIF format. This
    API uses a system of profiles respecting the following pattern:
    extractor_language_setting. Where extractor correspond to one of the
    available methods. Next, language must be the language for which Stanford
    CoreNLP will be set, and name is the name of the setting.
